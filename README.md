# shoe_search_script
A script I whipped together to search for shoes on Sportchek quickly to save time.

one fine day I found myself searching for 10+ pairs of shoes manually by opening new chrome tabs and searching on sportchek for the shoe, it was getting mundane, so I made this script to do it for me.

I've hardcoded a List of shoe names seperated by commas, the script does the rest when it runs.
